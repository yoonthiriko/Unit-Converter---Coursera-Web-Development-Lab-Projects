# Unit-Converter---Coursera-Web-Development-Lab-Projects
Description
This project is a basic unit converter that allows users to convert between:

Temperature: Celsius to Fahrenheit
Weight: Kilograms to Pounds
Distance: Kilometers to Miles
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an easy-to-use interface for quick and accurate conversions.

Rounding is applied for weight and distance conversions to display results up to 2 decimal places.

Requirements
Any modern web browser that supports JavaScript.
Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS to modify the interface as needed.
